    "## How Foundation Models Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in Training a Foundation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Large volumes of text data are gathered from various sources (books, articles, websites) to create a diverse training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - The text is tokenized, breaking it down into words or sub-words. This step is crucial as it transforms raw text into a format that the model can process.\n",
    "   - Additional preprocessing steps may include cleaning the data, removing irrelevant content, and normalizing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Architecture Design**:\n",
    "   - The backbone of most LLMs is the **transformer architecture**, known for its self-attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.\n",
    "   - There are two primary types of transformer architectures:\n",
    "     - **Transformer Encoder**: Processes input sequences and captures semantic meaning.\n",
    "     - **Transformer Decoder**: Generates output sequences based on an initial vector or input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training**:\n",
    "   - LLMs typically use **self-supervised learning**. For instance, BERT employs masked language modeling where random tokens are masked, and the model learns to predict them using surrounding context.\n",
    "   - The GPT series predicts the next word in a sequence based on previous words, training the model through exposure to vast text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - After training, the model is evaluated on specific tasks to assess its performance and fine-tune it if necessary.\n",
    "   - Evaluation may involve metrics like perplexity for language models or specific benchmarks in the case of downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompts**: The input given to the model to generate output. It can be a question, instruction, or statement.\n",
    "- **Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **Instruction Prompt**: A simple command (e.g., \"What are the symptoms of flu?\").\n",
    "  - **Role Assignment**: Assigning a role (e.g., \"You are a doctor.\").\n",
    "  - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples to guide the model’s output.\n",
    "  - **Chain of Thought Prompting**: Encouraging the model to explain its reasoning process step-by-step.\n",
    "  - **Self-Consistency**: Generating multiple responses and choosing the most frequent answer.\n",
    "  - **Generative Knowledge**: Generating and integrating facts before producing a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multimodal Foundation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- These models process different data types, such as text and images, using similar transformer architectures.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **DALL·E**: Generates images from textual descriptions by mapping text to visual features and decoding them into images.\n",
    "  - **Whisper**: A model for speech recognition that encodes audio into vectors for processing.\n",
