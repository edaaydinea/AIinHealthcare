    "- The field of AI in healthcare is experiencing exponential growth, with medical literature on AI applications expanding rapidly. In 2019, over 9,000 articles related to AI and healthcare were published, a fourfold increase over the previous decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges in Assessing AI Solutions:**\n",
    "- Despite the hype, most AI models featured in research are not directly executable in clinical practice.\n",
    "- Typical research focuses on:\n",
    "  - Clinical problems justifying AI use.\n",
    "  - Model architecture (e.g., CNN, machine learning models).\n",
    "  - Accuracy or precision metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F-measure).\n",
    "  - General thoughts on potential clinical application.\n",
    "  \n",

    "- How effective are these solutions in real-world settings?\n",
    "- Have they improved care or patient outcomes?\n",
    "- How do we define a *good* AI solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluating AI Beyond Accuracy:**\n",
    "- **Accuracy and precision metrics** alone are insufficient to evaluate an AI solution's true impact in healthcare.\n",
    "- A good AI solution should not only be technically sound but also demonstrate real-world clinical effectiveness and improve patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Framework for Evaluating AI in Healthcare:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clinical Utility:**\n",
    "   - Does the AI model address a significant clinical problem?\n",
    "   - How does it integrate into existing workflows?\n",
    "   - Is it feasible for clinicians to use in real-time?\n",
    "   \n",

    "## Questions Answered by AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge of Clinical Utility in AI Models for Healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus on Available Labeled Datasets:**\n",
    "- Many AI applications in healthcare, especially in predictive modeling, leverage readily available labeled datasets such as images or well-documented patient outcomes (e.g., readmissions or mortality).\n",
    "- While this approach enables progress, it often leads researchers to focus on model performance (e.g., accuracy, C-statistics) without addressing the model's practical utility in clinical settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case Study: Hospital Readmission Prediction**\n",
    "- In 2011, a systematic review analyzed prediction models for hospital readmissions:\n",
    "  - About 8,000 citations were reviewed, and 30 studies met inclusion criteria.\n",
    "  - Most models used **retrospective administrative data** and had poor discriminative power, with C-statistics under 0.8.\n",
    "  - Only one study specifically focused on **preventable** readmissions, meaning most research efforts stopped at risk prediction without addressing clinical actionability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Utility Gap:**\n",
    "- **Prediction alone is insufficient**: Identifying patients at high risk of readmission does not necessarily aid clinical decision-making if the model doesn’t provide actionable insights.\n",
    "- **Clinical intuition**: Often, clinicians can already estimate which patients are at risk based on experience. The value of AI comes when it offers **new, actionable insights** beyond what is already known.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example of Actionable AI:**\n",
    "- A model that not only predicts readmission but also identifies **modifiable factors** during the inpatient stay (e.g., prolonged prophylaxis post-surgery) could improve patient care by suggesting specific actions to reduce risk.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Barriers to Effective AI Implementation:**\n",
    "1. **Lack of Actionability**: Models often fail to suggest steps for mitigating predicted risks.\n",
    "2. **No Integration with Clinical Workflow**: Most algorithms are developed without considering how they will fit into the busy clinical environment.\n",
    "3. **Overlooking Clinical Feasibility**: Models might not account for the practical constraints clinicians face, such as time, resource availability, or the complexity of interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "AI models in healthcare should go beyond mere prediction. They need to provide **clinically useful** and **actionable insights** to improve patient outcomes. This requires a shift from focusing on technical model performance to considering the **clinical utility**, **feasibility**, and **impact** of AI solutions on real-world care delivery."

    "### Evaluating an AI Solution in Healthcare: Moving Beyond Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starting Point: Beyond Accuracy**\n",
    "- A common pitfall in evaluating AI models in healthcare is stopping after achieving a high-performance metric like accuracy (e.g., a model predicting 30-day hospital readmissions with 94% accuracy). However, accuracy alone doesn’t provide insight into **clinical actionability**—what happens **next** after the prediction is made?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patient Timeline and Prediction Windows:**\n",
    "- When evaluating an AI solution, it's important to think about a **patient's timeline** and the **window of observation** used for making predictions.\n",
    "  - In the case of hospital readmissions, this observation window might be during the inpatient stay.\n",
    "  - The prediction, such as the likelihood of readmission, is made at a set time point (e.g., at discharge), and you calculate a probability (e.g., 0.92).\n",
    "  - After the prediction, there is a **window of action**—the time between the prediction and the event occurring—during which healthcare providers can take steps to mitigate the predicted event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acute vs. Long-term Predictions:**\n",
    "- The **window of action** can vary based on the type of prediction:\n",
    "  - **Acute predictions** (e.g., patient deterioration within minutes or hours) require immediate action.\n",
    "  - **Long-term predictions** (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease based on genetics) may not require action for years or even decades.\n",
    "  - Regardless of the timeline, **early warning lead times** are valuable because they provide more opportunity for intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Cardiac Arrest Prediction**\n",
    "- Predicting cardiac arrest two minutes before the event gives clinicians little time to act, but predicting it two hours in advance provides more time to prevent the event.\n",
    "  - This highlights the importance of **early predictions** that allow for timely actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadening the Scope: From Prediction to Action\n",
    "- Most current efforts in AI research focus on **data collection** and **model development** (e.g., data aggregation, model architecture, accuracy metrics). However, little attention is paid to the **action** side of the equation—what clinicians should do after receiving a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introducing the Outcome Action Pairing (OAP) Framework:**\n",
    "- The **Outcome Action Pairing (OAP)** framework helps conceptualize the relationship between the **outcome** predicted by the AI model and the **action** that follows the prediction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. **Outcome**: The purpose of the AI model, such as disease diagnosis, risk stratification, or event prediction.\n",
    "     - Example: Predicting 30-day hospital readmissions.\n",
    "  2. **Action**: The step that can be taken based on the outcome to improve patient care.\n",
    "     - Example: A different treatment pathway based on risk, a scheduled follow-up to prevent readmission, or specific interventions triggered by a diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Importance of Actionable AI Solutions:**\n",
    "- For AI models to be useful in clinical practice, they must go beyond providing predictions to suggesting or enabling **clear, actionable steps** that improve patient outcomes.\n",
    "- The **action** must align with clinical workflows and be feasible for healthcare teams to implement, ensuring the model’s integration into routine care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion: Moving Beyond Prediction\n",
    "To evaluate AI solutions in healthcare:\n",
    "1. Understand the **window of action** and whether the AI model provides enough lead time for meaningful intervention.\n",
    "2. Use the **Outcome Action Pairing (OAP)** framework to ensure that the model’s predictions lead to actionable steps that improve clinical care.\n",
    "3. Consider **who** will use the prediction and how it will fit into the healthcare setting, aiming for practical, actionable, and integrated AI solutions.\n",
