    "3. **Are the data accessible?**\n",
    "   - How do you obtain the data? Are there any restrictions, and is access prohibitively expensive?\n",

    "4. **What are the known errors in the data?**\n",
    "   - Are there missing values or other quality issues? Addressing these problems can be time-consuming.\n",

    "- **Do the data contain the patient characteristics you need to observe?**\n",
    "  - If not, can you use a proxy?\n",
