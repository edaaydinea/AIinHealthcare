    "## Challenges in electronic phenotyping\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "Electronic phenotyping involves using electronic health records (EHRs) to identify and characterize patient phenotypes. This process relies on the accurate extraction and interpretation of patient data from a timeline of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy of Disease Codes**:\n",
    "   - **Initial Assignment**: Disease codes (ICD9, ICD10) might be assigned during the diagnostic process, even before a definitive diagnosis is made. This can lead to incorrect codes being recorded if the final diagnosis is negative.\n",
    "   - **Timing of Codes**: Codes may be assigned at discharge or later, which might not reflect the true onset of the condition. For instance, a condition may develop during hospitalization but only be coded upon discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature vs. Phenotype**:\n",
    "   - **Feature**: Directly measured data (e.g., blood pressure readings).\n",
    "   - **Phenotype**: Inferred or interpreted condition derived from features (e.g., hypertension, which considers blood pressure measurements along with additional factors like medication and lab results).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phenotyping Process**: Requires careful selection of data and timing to accurately capture the occurrence and timing of events of interest.\n",
    "- **Feature Interpretation**: Distinguishing between raw features and derived phenotypes is crucial for accurate analysis.\n",
    "- **Temporal Considerations**: The timing of data entry and code assignment can impact the phenotyping outcome, making it important to align data accurately with clinical events.\n"

    "## Specifying an electronic phenotype\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifying an Electronic Phenotype\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Criteria for Specification**:\n",
    "   - **Necessary and Sufficient Conditions**: Define the required features and their values to determine if an exposure or outcome of interest occurred.\n",
    "   - **Start and End Times**: Identify when the condition or exposure begins and ends. \n",
    "     - **Start Time**: Often straightforward, based on the initial appearance of relevant features.\n",
    "     - **End Time**: More challenging to determine, as symptoms or conditions may persist beyond the acute phase (e.g., pneumonia symptoms lingering after infection).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining the Phenotype**:\n",
    "   - **Intended Meaning**: Clarify whether the phenotype refers to a current condition or a historical one. Accurate specification is crucial.\n",
    "   - **Specification Format**: Can be in plain language, formal computer-based specifications, or specialized languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluating an Electronic Phenotype\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validation**:\n",
    "   - **Reference Standard**: Typically involves comparison with a complete review of patient charts by trained clinicians.\n",
    "   - **Challenges**: Time-consuming and may involve disagreements among clinicians.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Considerations**:\n",
    "   - **Effect Magnitude**: Determine how much error in phenotype definition can be tolerated based on the research question.\n",
    "   - **Portability**: Assess how well a phenotype definition developed at one site applies to data from another site.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accurate Definition**: Essential for ensuring the phenotype reflects the intended condition and is useful for analysis.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Methods**: Important for validating the phenotype and understanding its applicability across different settings.\n"

    "## Two approaches to phenotyping\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categories of Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rules-Based Approach**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Uses explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to define phenotypes.\n",
    "   - **Construction**: Criteria are created by experts who reach consensus through iterative processes. This often involves reviewing sample case records to refine the criteria.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Typically involves manual definition of rules based on clinical knowledge and data review.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probabilistic Phenotyping**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Utilizes machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of a patient having the exposure or outcome of interest.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Machine learning algorithms learn from data to assign probabilities to patient records, indicating the likelihood of the condition or exposure.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Involves training models on historical data to predict outcomes or exposures, rather than relying on predefined rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rules-Based Approach**: Relies on expert knowledge and consensus, and involves defining criteria explicitly.\n",
    "- **Probabilistic Phenotyping**: Leverages machine learning to estimate probabilities, potentially capturing complex patterns in the data.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Flowchart-Based Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - The type 2 diabetes phenotype is expressed as a flowchart (algorithm) to systematically determine whether a patient has the condition.\n",
    "   - Steps in the algorithm involve checking various patient records and medical data to make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Overview**:\n",
    "   - **Step 1**: Check for a diagnosis of **type 1 diabetes**. If present, the patient is excluded from having type 2 diabetes.\n",
    "   - **Step 2**: If no type 1 diabetes diagnosis is found, check for **type 2 diabetes diagnosis codes**.\n",
    "   - **Step 3**: If no type 2 diabetes diagnosis is present, evaluate other factors:\n",
    "     - **Prescriptions for type 2 diabetes drugs**.\n",
    "     - **Relevant abnormal lab values**.\n",
    "   - If these factors are present, the patient is still classified as having type 2 diabetes, even in the absence of a formal diagnosis code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation Beyond Diagnosis Codes**: Diagnosis codes alone are insufficient for accurate phenotyping. The addition of prescription information, lab values, and the **timing** of these events provides a more reliable assessment.\n",
    "- **Timeline View of Patient Record**: The sequence and timing of events in the patient's medical history play a crucial role in phenotype determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Sources for Phenotyping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Billing Codes**: Useful but not always fully accurate.\n",
    "- **Clinical Text and Medical Records**: Contain additional features that, when combined with codes, improve phenotype accuracy.\n",
    "- **Way 2015 Paper**: Demonstrates the relative value of these different data sources and their utility in constructing phenotype definitions for various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Combining multiple data sources (e.g., codes, prescriptions, lab results) enhances the accuracy of phenotyping.\n",
    "- **Condition-Specific**: The relative importance of different data sources varies depending on the disease or phenotype of interest.\n"

    "## Constructing a rule based phenotype definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Identify Relevant Data Elements**:\n",
    "   - Determine which **data elements** (e.g., symptoms, lab results, diagnoses, medications) should appear in a patient’s record to infer the condition of interest.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### 2. **Convert Data Elements to Specific Identifiers**:\n",
    "   - Use a **knowledge graph** to map the identified data elements to specific standardized identifiers like:\n",
    "     - **ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes** (diagnosis codes)\n",
    "     - **Medication codes** (e.g., NDC codes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Create the Phenotype Definition**:\n",
    "   - Specify the following:\n",
    "     - **Necessary and Sufficient Conditions**: Define the minimum required data elements for the condition and additional factors that confirm it.\n",
    "     - **Presence or Absence**: Specify which data elements must be present or absent in the patient’s record.\n",
    "     - **Frequency of Occurrence**: Determine how often the elements must appear (e.g., number of visits or prescriptions).\n",
    "     - **Start and End Conditions**: Identify when the condition begins and ends based on the data elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Iterate and Validate**:\n",
    "   - **Comparison to Reference Standard**: Validate the definition by comparing it against a clinician-reviewed full chart (gold standard).\n",
    "   - **Iterative Process**: Refine the definition in repeated cycles, asking:\n",
    "     - Are the **necessary and sufficient conditions** clearly defined?\n",
    "     - Does the definition correctly identify the **start and end** of the condition?\n",
    "     - Are the **data elements** comprehensive and accurate for identifying the phenotype?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Achieve Consensus**:\n",
    "   - Repeat the process of refining the definition until consensus is reached among medical experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Elements to Codes**: Use knowledge graphs to convert clinical features into standardized identifiers.\n",
    "- **Necessary/Sufficient Conditions**: Define clear criteria for presence/absence and frequency of data elements.\n",
    "- **Validation and Refinement**: Compare the phenotype definition to clinical reviews, refining it iteratively for accuracy.\n"

    "## Probabilistic phenotyping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Thought Experiment: Chief Data Scientist Role**:\n",
    "   - **Challenge**: Identify patients with one of 50 different conditions within one week.\n",
    "   - **Limitation of Rule-Based Phenotyping**: One week is too short to define and refine 50 rule-based phenotypes using medical experts, unless existing work can be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Solution: Automating Phenotype Construction**:\n",
    "   - **Machine Learning Approach**: Automate the construction of phenotypes using **supervised machine learning** methods.\n",
    "   - **Supervised Learning Process**:\n",
    "     - Start with a **training set**, where each patient is labeled as having (or not having) the condition of interest and when in their timeline this occurred.\n",
    "     - Use the training set to build a **computational model** capable of classifying new, unseen patients as having or not having the condition.\n",

    "## Approaches for creating a probabilistic phenotype definition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Billing Code Counts as Probabilities**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Count how often **billing codes** appear for each patient.\n",
    "     - **Interpretation**: Higher counts suggest a higher **probability** of having the phenotype, while lower counts may be spurious.\n",
    "     - **Clustering**: Use the computed probabilities to cluster patients into those likely or unlikely to have the condition.\n",
    "   - **Key Insight**: It’s often easier to get **more imperfectly labeled data** than to increase the accuracy of the labels.\n",
    "   - **Error Reduction with Sample Size**: Increasing the **sample size** can reduce error rates in labeling. The formula for the expansion of sample size based on error rate $ t $ is:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{Expansion Factor} = \\frac{1}{(1 - 2t)^2}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Example: A sample size of 1,500 with an error rate of 21% can still yield a good classifier with enough data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Keyword-Based Phenotyping**:\n",
    "   - **Method**:\n",
    "     - Start with **keywords** related to the condition (e.g., myocardial infarction).\n",
    "     - Use a **knowledge graph** to expand the set of related terms.\n",
    "     - Include all patients with **non-negated mentions** of the keywords on their timeline.\n",
    "     - Train a classifier using these features to classify the phenotype.\n",
    "   - **Performance**: This method worked well for conditions like **diabetes mellitus**, **myocardial infarction**, and **familial hypercholesterolemia**, but less so for conditions like **celiac disease**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Anchor-Based Labeling**:\n",
    "   - **Anchor Concept**:\n",
    "     - An **anchor** is a reliable indicator of the presence of a phenotype.\n",
    "     - Seeing an anchor means a patient **very likely** has the condition, but **absence of an anchor** does not imply the absence of the condition.\n",
    "   - **Use in Labeling**: Anchors serve as a **labeling function** to generate large amounts of training data for a classifier.\n",
    "   - **Performance Improvement**: Track how classifier performance improves by adding more anchors.\n",
    "     - Example: For **myocardial infarction**, performance improves with the first few anchors but **plateaus** after a certain number.\n",
    "   - **Effort-Precision Trade-off**: A **small human effort** yields large amounts of training data and captures most of the improvement in phenotype classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Billing Code Counts**: Higher counts increase confidence in the phenotype classification.\n",
    "- **Imperfect Data**: Using large datasets and efficient labeling strategies (e.g., keyword expansion or anchors) can yield accurate classifiers despite imperfect labels.\n",
    "- **Anchor-Based Approach**: Anchors provide reliable but incomplete labeling, striking a balance between **human effort** and **classifier accuracy**.\n"
