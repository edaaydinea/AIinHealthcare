## Ethical frameworks for health care and for AI

#### **Professional Ethics in Healthcare**

**Professional Definition:** Professionals (e.g., doctors, lawyers, teachers) are those who, while often compensated, serve public interests and are bound by ethical codes. They have fiduciary responsibilities, prioritizing the well-being of clients over personal or external interests.

**Fiduciary Responsibilities:** Professionals are entrusted with significant powers, such as access to private health information or performing actions considered criminal in other contexts (e.g., administering anesthesia, performing surgery). This leeway is based on the assumption that their actions are in the best interest of their clients, even if they involve some level of harm.

**Self-Regulation:** Professionals are often self-regulated through professional associations, which:

*   Set standards for licensure and competence.
*   Provide oversight for medical misconduct.
*   Define good and bad practices and determine who can practice.

#### **Ethical Frameworks for AI in Healthcare**

**Professional Codes of Ethics:**

*   **Purpose:** Guide AI development and application in healthcare by ensuring AI tools align with ethical practices and serve public interests.
*   **Self-Regulation:** Like healthcare professionals, AI developers and researchers must adhere to ethical standards to maintain trust and ensure safety and effectiveness.

**Regulatory Systems:**

*   **Role:** Evaluate drugs, devices, and clinical practices to ensure safety and effectiveness.
*   **Importance:** Trust in these systems is crucial for the successful implementation of AI in healthcare. AI systems must comply with existing regulations and contribute to the overall goal of improving patient care.

**Interplay of Interests:**

*   **Conflicting Interests:** Healthcare providers and organizations face competing interests, including financial motivations.
*   **Impact on AI:** Financial and structural interests can influence the alignment or misalignment of AI models with patient care objectives. Understanding these dynamics is essential to ensure AI technologies support, rather than compromise, patient well-being.

#### **Summary**

Ethical considerations in the development and use of AI in healthcare involve:

*   Adhering to professional codes of ethics and fiduciary responsibilities.
*   Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining trust in evaluation systems.
*   Navigating the interplay of financial and structural interests to align AI models with the best interests of patients.

## AI and incentives in health care delivery and payment structures

#### **Incentives in Healthcare Systems**

*   **Explicit Incentives:** Healthcare systems use incentives, such as increased copayments for emergency services, to influence the behavior of patients and providers, aiming to improve efficiency.
*   **Goals of Incentives:**
    *   **Improve Quality:** Enhance healthcare services.
    *   **Reduce Costs:** Lower expenses and utilization of resources.

#### **Role of AI in Healthcare**

*   **Predictive Analytics:** AI is particularly effective at classifying and predicting outcomes using large datasets, including electronic health records and digital images.
    *   **Applications:** AI models help classify and predict various aspects of healthcare, such as patient outcomes, risks, and resource utilization.
    *   **Types of Risks:**
        *   **Financial Risk:** Probability of financial loss associated with healthcare use.
        *   **Medical Harm:** Risks from medical errors or inappropriate treatment due to uncertainty or incentive structures.

#### **Ethical Challenges in AI Models**

**Bias and Discrimination:**

*   **Vulnerable Populations:** AI models predicting high healthcare costs may disproportionately affect vulnerable groups (e.g., poor, disabled, racial and ethnic minorities) due to systemic issues like lower access to preventive care.
*   **Risk Adjustment:** To avoid discrimination, models must accurately adjust for risk factors, distinguishing between high costs due to illness severity and those due to demographic characteristics.

**Proxy Measures:**

*   **Data Limitations:** Healthcare data often serve as proxies for desired measurements, which can introduce systematic error or bias.
*   **Example:** Risk adjustment models may lack social factors (e.g., income, education) that significantly impact health outcomes, leading to incomplete or skewed predictions.

**Model Design and Ethical Implications:**

*   **Systematic Error:** Imperfect proxy measures can result in biased predictions, potentially harming specific patient groups.
*   **Data Familiarity:** A deep understanding of clinical characteristics and data limitations is essential to mitigate ethical issues and avoid harm.

#### **Case Study: Insurance Predictive Models**

*   **Example:** An insurance company uses AI to predict high-cost members based on claims and health records.
    *   **Ethical Concern:** The model must account for factors like race and socioeconomic status to avoid unfairly targeting vulnerable populations.

#### **Summary**

AI in healthcare has significant potential for improving efficiency and predicting outcomes. However, ethical challenges include managing bias, accurately adjusting for risk, and addressing limitations of proxy measures. Ensuring that AI models are designed with a thorough understanding of patient data and potential biases is crucial to minimizing harm and achieving fair outcomes.

## More examples of AI and incentives in health care delivery and paymeny structures

#### **Incentive-Driven Healthcare Systems**

*   **Purpose of Incentives:** Healthcare systems use incentives to improve efficiency and quality of care by reducing unnecessary services and costs.
*   **Examples of Incentives:**
    *   **Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP):** Fines hospitals for excess readmissions within 30 days for specific conditions, such as heart attacks or pneumonia, aiming to reduce avoidable readmissions.

#### **AI Applications in Predictive Analytics**

**Hospital Readmissions Prediction:**

*   **Model Use:** Companies develop AI models to predict the likelihood of patient readmissions within 30 days.
*   **Impact:** While reducing readmissions is a goal, unintended consequences include:
    *   **Reduced Care:** Hospitals may retain patients in observational units or pressure nursing homes to avoid readmissions, potentially delaying necessary care.
    *   **Access Issues:** Patients might be discouraged from seeking timely care or be less likely to be admitted initially if they are predicted to be high-risk.

**Bundled Payments for Joint Replacements:**

*   **Model Use:** AI models predict patient costs associated with joint replacements to facilitate bundled payment programs, which pay providers a fixed amount for all care within an episode.
*   **Impact:** Bundled payments aim to improve care coordination across providers but may also:
    *   **Financial Pressure:** Providers may focus on identifying low-cost or high-cost patients, which could affect patient care and outcomes.
    *   **Disparities:** Evidence suggests that African-American patients are less likely to receive joint replacements and more likely to be discharged to facilities leading to readmissions. Predictive models that do not adjust for these disparities may exacerbate them.

#### **Ethical Considerations**

**Unintended Consequences of Incentives:**

*   **Quality of Care:** Financial incentives might lead to practices that compromise patient care or result in discrimination against vulnerable populations.
*   **Behavioral Effects:** The way predictive models are used can influence provider behavior in ways that might unintentionally harm patients.

**Data and Bias Issues:**

*   **Proxy Measures:** AI models often rely on proxy measures which may not fully capture the factors affecting patient outcomes. This can lead to systematic errors and biases.
*   **Risk Adjustment:** Models must accurately adjust for risk factors to avoid reinforcing existing health disparities.

**Model Design and Implementation:**

*   **Understanding Healthcare Delivery:** Building ethical AI models requires a deep understanding of healthcare delivery and payment systems.
